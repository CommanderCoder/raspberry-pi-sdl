BUILD

   You need the arm-none-eabi toolchain available from
   https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded

   Compile with:

      make all

   Each folder has its own Makefile and can be compiled separately.

INSTALL

   The applications folders abbaye and template builds a kernel.img file that
   must be copied to an SD card along with the firmware files:

      bootcode.bin
      config.txt
      fixup_cd.dat
      fixup.dat
      start_cd.elf
      start.elf

   Firmware files can be downloaded from
   https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/tree/master/boot

   Please note that the csud library has a bug that crashes the application
   when used with firmware files release after october 2012. The code,
   without csud support, was tested using firmware files dated july 5, 2013,
   any later firmware may not work correctly.
